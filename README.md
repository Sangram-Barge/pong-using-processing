# pong-using-processing
The missed attempt to code pong on processing. The code is buggy, but still works :-)
The Player2 needs to be programmed properly(I've just been lazy and tracked the Y location of ball for the position of player2, which means you cant simply win this game)
# pong in processing (OOP)
This version is made using Object Oriented approach, the first one worked fine but I just wanted to give it another try. This code is less cluttered than first one.
